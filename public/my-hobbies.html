<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<p>I have a wide range of hobbies that bring joy, creativity, and balance into my life.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reading and collecting books</li>
        <li>Gardening</li>
        <li>Making natural cosmetics</li>
        <li>Daily walks with my dog Bagi</li>
    </ol>

<p>One of my greatest passions is reading and collecting books. There's something deeply comforting about holding a book in your hands, turning its pages, and getting lost in a story or learning something new. Over the years, my personal library has grown into a collection that reflects my curiosity and love for literature.</p>

<p>Gardening is another hobby that brings me great satisfaction. Whether I'm planting herbs, vegetables, or flowers, working with soil and watching things grow gives me a sense of calm and purpose. It's a rewarding process that connects me with nature and teaches patience and care.</p>

<p>I also love creating natural cosmetics. Blending oils, herbs, and other organic ingredients to make my own skincare products is both a creative and sustainable practice. It feels good to know exactly what I'm putting on my skin, and even better when I can share these homemade products with friends and family.</p>

<p>Daily walks with my dog are a cherished part of my routine. Not only is it a time for exercise and fresh air, but it's also a moment to disconnect from the busy world and simply enjoy the present moment. My dog, Bagi, is not just a companion—she's a source of joy, motivation, and unconditional love.</p>

<p>These hobbies enrich my life and reflect my values: curiosity, creativity, connection with nature, and mindful living.</p>
